I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://di.ku.dk/english/) at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/), supervised by [Prof. Wouter Boomsma](https://di.ku.dk/Ansatte/?pure=da/persons/275482). My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, life science, and chemistry. Prior to PhD, I was a Research Engineer in the [Institute for AI Industry Research](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/our_team/Research_Team.htm) at the Tsinghua University.
