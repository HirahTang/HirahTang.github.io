# Evaluating Structural Prediction Models Over Proteins Containing NCAAs and PTMs

Protein structure prediction has made tremendous advances with tools like AlphaFold and ColabFold, but how well do these models perform on proteins containing non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs) and post-translational modifications (PTMs)?

## The Challenge

While standard protein structure prediction models excel at canonical proteins, they face unique challenges when dealing with:

- **Non-canonical amino acids (NCAAs)**: Amino acids beyond the standard 20
- **Post-translational modifications (PTMs)**: Chemical modifications that occur after protein synthesis

## Current Research Directions

My research focuses on understanding and improving how current prediction models handle these modified proteins. This work is particularly relevant for:

1. Drug design targeting modified proteins
2. Understanding disease mechanisms involving PTMs
3. Synthetic biology applications using NCAAs

## Methodology

We're systematically evaluating existing models by:
- Creating curated datasets of proteins with known NCAAs and PTMs
- Benchmarking prediction accuracy against experimental structures
- Identifying specific failure modes and improvement opportunities

## Implications

Better prediction models for modified proteins could accelerate research in personalized medicine, where understanding individual protein variants is crucial for treatment design.
