# Welcome to My Research Blog!

I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences as a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Copenhagen's Department of Computer Science.

## What You Can Expect

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Research Updates**: Progress on my work in machine learning applications to chemistry and life sciences
- **Learning Experiences**: Insights from my academic journey and collaboration with Prof. Wouter Boomsma
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Detailed explanations of interesting problems and solutions
- **Conference Notes**: Takeaways from academic conferences and workshops

## My Research Focus

My work intersects several exciting areas:

1. **Machine Learning for Chemistry**: Developing algorithms to predict molecular properties
2. **Protein Structure Analysis**: Using AI to understand protein folding patterns
3. **Drug Discovery**: Applying computational methods to identify potential therapeutics

## Background

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Engineer at Tsinghua University's Institute for AI Industry Research. This industry experience has given me a unique perspective on how to bridge academic research with practical applications.

## Looking Forward

I'm looking forward to sharing this journey with you! Feel free to reach out if you have questions about my research or want to discuss any of the topics I'll be covering.
